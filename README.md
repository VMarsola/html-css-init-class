## Aula 02 - Clone YouTube Sidebar

This lesson will introduce students to Flexbox, a powerful CSS layout tool that allows developers to create flexible and responsive layouts without having to use complex calculations or positioning.

## Aula 03 - Clone Mercado Livre Section

Building on the previous lesson, students will get more practice with Flexbox by cloning a section of the popular Brazilian e-commerce website, Mercado Livre.

## Aula 04 - Columns and Rows with Sass
